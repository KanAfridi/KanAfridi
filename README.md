# 👋 Hi, I'm Binyameen Khan Afridi!

### 🌍 About Me
I'm a 25-year-old **Data Analyst** from Pakistan with a passion for uncovering insights from data. I've been diving deep into **data analytics** for over two and a half years, working on projects that span from **exploratory data analysis** to **machine learning**. 

My main language is **Python**, where I’m comfortable with libraries like **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib** for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). I also have hands-on experience with **MySQL**, **Power BI**, and **Excel** for data management and visualization. In addition, I know how to use **Docker** and **GitHub Actions** to set up automated workflows, and I can build simple web apps in **Streamlit** to display my models.
